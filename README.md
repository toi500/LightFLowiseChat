## Description

An straightforward Chatbot UI modified to integrate with Flowise.

## Key Features

-   Clean and Minimalist Design: The UI prioritizes a sleek aesthetic.
-   Fully responsive on mobile

## Usage Instructions

1.  Obtain Flowise API Credentials:
    -   Access your Flowise instance and navigate to the API settings section.
    -   Locate your API Endpoint and API Key.
      
2.  Set Up the Chatbot UI:
    -   Open the `script.js` file within the project directory.
    -   Locate the designated sections for API Endpoint and API Key.
    -   Replace the placeholder values with your actual Flowise credentials.


## Important Note

-   The current implementation does not integrate the `chat_history` variable. It works but it is not fully functional.
